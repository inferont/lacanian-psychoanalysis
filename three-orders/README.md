Orders

As I understand Lacan, these are largely the dimensions of both unconscious and conscious thought. 

1. Class: Real
    Description: Represents the order of the Real, focusing on the inexpressible and unknowable aspects.
    Features to train on:
    * Drives
    * Sensations
    * Jouissance
    
    The largest aspect of the conscious experience. An experiential filter.
      
    In relation: Imaginary and Symbolic
   
    The actual values of these will be "unknowable." A network will be trained to return Drive/Sensation/Jouissance values in relation to the Imaginary and Symbolic orders.
       
    Methods:
        Overrides `interact` to model interactions specific to the Real's nature, such as resistance to symbolization.

3. Class: Imaginary
    Description: Encapsulates the Imaginary order, dealing with images, illusions, and the ego's formation.
    Properties:
    * Schemas of others
    * Elements related to self-image and mirroring.
   
    Methods:
        Overrides `interact` to reflect the Imaginary's role in identity formation and the mirroring process.

5. Class: Symbolic
    Description: Encompasses the Symbolic order, related to language, law, and social structure.
    Properties:
        Structures like language, law, norms.

    Methods:
        Overrides `interact` to incorporate the Symbolic's mediating role in human desires and its structuring of social relations.
