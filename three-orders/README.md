Orders

As I understand Lacan, these are largely the dimensions of both unconscious and conscious thought. 

1. Class: Real
    Description: Represents the order of the Real, focusing on the inexpressible and unknowable aspects.
    Properties:
       Drives
       Sensation
       Jouissance
       
    Methods:
        Overrides `interact` to model interactions specific to the Real's nature, such as resistance to symbolization.

3. Class: Imaginary
    Description: Encapsulates the Imaginary order, dealing with images, illusions, and the ego's formation.
    Properties:
       Schemas of others
        Elements related to self-image and mirroring.
    Methods:
        Overrides `interact` to reflect the Imaginary's role in identity formation and the mirroring process.

5. Class: Symbolic
    Description: Encompasses the Symbolic order, related to language, law, and social structure.
    Properties:
        Structures like language, law, norms.
    Methods:
        Overrides `interact` to incorporate the Symbolic's mediating role in human desires and its structuring of social relations.
